### The Goal

----
> I want to test out this new `<insert thing>`
> that `I found` / `I built` / `my boss wants me to use`.
----

- Models
- Training paradigms
- Algorithms
- Datastores
- Libraries
- Serving solutions
- Observability tooling
- Messaging queues

---

### The Requirements

----
> I only need access to the production account.
> It's just easier that way. You won't notice a thing, I promise.
----

- Production-like `environment`
- New `services`
- Alternate `dependencies`
- Specialized `hardware`
- Specific `knowledge`
- Data `access`

---

### The Problems

----
> The logging budget for `<insert env>` is gone again.
> Table tennis anyone?
----

- Available environments are `shared` (disruptions / data / security)
- Experiment `reproducability`
- Environment setup `slow`
- Temporary environments are `idle` or `forgotten`
- My computer is a `potato` (~~or an ARM Mac~~)

---

### A Solution

----

> **Ephemeral Environments**

----

- `Ephemerality` is built into their design
- Reasonably `fast` setup
- They should encourage knowledge `reuse`
- Effecient `resource` usage
- `Auditable` access controls
- As `isolated` as necessary

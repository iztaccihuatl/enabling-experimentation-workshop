# Enabling Experimentation

## Quick Start

You only require 3 things:

- Docker
- Visual Studio Code
- Dev Containers extension

After you open this repository in vscode, it should ask you if you want to reopen it in a devcontainer.
Once that's done open a terminal in vscode, run `task demo:up` and wait until it is finished.

You should now be able to go to http://argocd.localhost and see gitlab and gitea bing deployed.
